this library is a collection of useful expressions and synthax in Mathematica
f[x_] := Sin[x] + 10
# getting the derivative of f:
f'[x]

# same thing different function:
f[x_] := 2 x + 12
D[f[x], x]

# the basic functions ad their synthax can be found here:

esc esc for special characters

f1 to get documentation on sth once it is marked blue and curser on it

manipulate and then a function to play with it (e.g. Manipulate[Plot[Sin[x (1 + a x)], {x, 0, 6}], {a, 0, 2}])
